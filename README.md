# BonziBot-LEGACY
This respiratory is for the LEGACY code for BonziBot.<br/>
A quick look at `App.java` will immediately reveal why<br/>
we decided to cancel the current project and start fresh.

## ~~A lot of this code will be reused.~~ update: na starting over
~~We will copy small portions of this project over to the new project<br/>
since some of the classes actually are well structured and usable.~~

## Please don't use this code.
If you want to steal code from a bot, this place isn't the one!<br/>
I mean, you shouldn't be copy/pasting code <b>anyways</b> but you should<br/>
stay away from this specifically because it's just not expandable or efficient.
